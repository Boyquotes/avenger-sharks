# Gameplay

* Necromancers...
  * Check hit boxes as should be 5 hits only... might need to remove collision from SharkSpray on a hit.

* Ability to shoot enemies when spawning in (but not collide)
* Replace power-ups with sprites (NOTE: Tilemap has animations too), and implement more....
  * Speed?
  * Bouncing shots?
  * Rapid fire
  * Exploding shots
  * Piercing shots
  * Mega Shark Mode?!
* Scenery / Obstacles in room (Tileset has boxes)

* Opens up possibilities of some rooms being special, e.g. just full of fish?
* Every x waves is a special room?

* When only x enemy left, give hint arrows // change their behaviour to hunt for all types.
* Keep count of fish rescued - use as currency in shop between x levels?
* Bonus points for collecting all fish at end of wave?
* Animation of fish being released back into the sea?

# Bugs

* Necromancers sometimes flicker after death / level transitions.
* Big spray doesn't work when player close to a wall.

# Flow

* Some form of intro

* IMMEDIATE

* Bring in replacement potion sprite
* Bring in treasure chest (Generic powerup sprite) - spawn text above e.g. BIG SPRAY!
* Remove Item tile support.

# Patch notes

* Enemies now flash on hit (Thanks Joe Pietroni for the suggestion!)
* New sprites used for items (Health, chest).
* Internal: Removed obsolete Pause.tscn and Pause.gd.
